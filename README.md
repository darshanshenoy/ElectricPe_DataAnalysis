This is a dataset provided by a Bengaluru based EV startup, ElectricPe. It contains data relating to Uptime and downtime of various charging stations throughout the day and on various dates. 

AssigmentData_ElectricPe- dataset given by the company.

We were given the following assignments-

Assignment Tasks:

1) Daily and Hourly Uptime Analysis:
    Examine the uptime of chargers across different days and hours. Identify any noticeable uptime patterns or trends.

2) Performance Comparison of Charger Stations:
    Compare the uptime performance of various stations. Highlight any stations with particularly high or low uptime and hypothesise potential reasons.

3) Correlation with Station Characteristics:
    Analyse if the uptime is influenced by the station's characteristics (type, category, access). Does the nature of the station affect its operational status?

4) Predictive Analysis for Future Uptime:
    Using the provided data, attempt to predict the uptime for the next day for a selected charger station. Explore the feasibility of forecasting potential downtimes.

   All these tasks are performed in the attached notebooks. Final Report is also attached which contains our inferences and accuracy results.
